## PyMDLog

PyMDLog is a Python-powered tool for analyzing log files generated by molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation packages.

## Introduction

I use MD packages, such as Amber and NAMD, in my research work. Each of them
generates log files (mdout in Amber's terminology) while computing. Properties
of the simulation system are recorded in the files. There are existing scripts
for parsing them, like process_mdout.perl for Amber and namdplot for NAMD.
However, I'm not satisfied with them. So I wrote this tool and made it publicly
available. I found it useful and hope it is also helpful to you.

## Prerequisites

* [Python](http://www.python.org/) >= 2.6

* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) (optional, for plotting)

## Installation

Once you have satisfied the requirements, run this command from the command
prompt:

    $ python setup.py install

## Usage

Make sure */PYTHONHOME/Scripts* is in the *PATH* environment variable. Then
run this command from the command prompt:

    $ pymdlog

The following GUI is fairly self-explanatory.

If you haven't installed matplotlib or don't like the generated figure, you
can use the output file with your favorite plotting software:

* "Simple" for Gnuplot, xmgrace, Origin

* "CSV" for R (use read.csv with header=FALSE), Excel

The above-mentioned have been tested, but other programs would be compatible
too.
